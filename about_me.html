    <h1>About Me</h1>

<section id="section1">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Hello there! I'm a researcher passionate about new 
        material exploration and synthesis with a particular focus on nano-fracturing and utilizing advanced techniques to study and create
        materials like superconductors, magnetic materials, strongly correlated systems, functional materials, and semiconductors. My work
        spans across both 3D and 2D systems, delving deep into the fascinating world of quantum materials and their intricate behaviors.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>In my research, I specialize in investigating the crystal structure and local atomic arrangements of novel crystals. These structural studies are key to understanding the phase transitions that materials undergo, whether it’s related to changes in crystal structures, the emergence of charge or spin density waves, or the appearance of nematic and magnetic orders. Exploring how materials transition through various states is fundamental to discovering new properties and functions.

I also manipulate low-dimensional quantum materials through both physical and chemical means, which allows us to finely tune their behaviors and properties. These efforts aim to understand and control anomalous phenomena such as the quantum and nonlinear anomalous Hall effects and the anomalous thermal Hall effect of phonons in both topological materials like TMDs (transition metal dichalcogenides), semimetals, and insulating materials, whether they are 3D or 2D in nature.

Moreover, I'm particularly intrigued by the novel quantum states that emerge from the formation of moiré superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures, where the periodic potential can induce extraordinary electronic behaviors. Understanding the properties of 2D materials and improving their device performance is a crucial aspect of my work, especially with their potential applications in next-generation technology.

In addition, I am exploring the phonon behavior in some unique 3D insulators, which can shed light on their thermal properties and their relevance to future technological innovations. Through these investigations, I aim to unlock the functional properties of these materials and uncover their potential applications in fields ranging from energy storage to advanced electronics.</p>

    <h2>Other Interests</h2>
    <p>In addition to my research, I am passionate about science outreach, especially for younger audiences. I enjoy demonstrating experiments like magnetic levitation using superconductors to inspire interest in physics.Join me in this exciting journey of exploring quantum materials and functional systems, and together, we may uncover the fundamental secrets that will drive the next wave of technological revolutions!</p>
