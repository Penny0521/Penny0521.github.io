    <h1>About Me</h1>
</header>

<section id="section1">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am a physicist specializing in condensed matter physics. I have a PhD in superconductivity and quantum materials research, and I currently work on projects related to superconductors, 2D material devices, and their physics. I also teach undergraduate and graduate courses in superconductivity, solid state physics, and basic physics.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>My research focuses on the exploration of new superconductors, studying materials under extreme conditions, and understanding quantum phenomena in novel materials. I am particularly interested in high-pressure physics, and I have experience with Raman spectroscopy and DAC systems for simulating Earth's internal environments.</p>

    <h2>Other Interests</h2>
    <p>In addition to my research, I am passionate about science outreach, especially for younger audiences. I enjoy demonstrating experiments like magnetic levitation using superconductors to inspire interest in physics.</p>
